- 👋 Hi, I’m @SPICEGOD
- 👀 I’m interested in mining ethereum
- 🥎 I'm also interested in creating a community of Black Farmers
 And providing them with defi that doesnt discriminate 
And allows them to borrow monies to expand, modernize, market
And pay off high interest loans or loans that jeopordize their land ownership
- 🌱 I’m currently learning anything that I can get ahold to. But I seeem scattered 
And would appreciate some direction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who will take the time to school me on the nuances of 
Decentralized web and metaverse.
- 📫 How to reach me ..hillnnamdi@gmail.com
